<script>
    import { Image } from '$lib/components/image';

    import Home from './838shots_so.jpg?enhanced';
    import Product from './800shots_so.jpg?enhanced';
    import List from './380shots_so.jpg?enhanced';
</script>

I redesigned the Urban Outfitters clothing shop on desktop to achieve a more minimalistic look wich lets the user navigate more easier. This was just a concept design.

<Image image={Home} alt="Screenshots of the homepage of the website." />

<Image image={List} alt="Screenshots of the list view with filters." />

<Image image={Product} alt="Screenshots of the product detail view." />
