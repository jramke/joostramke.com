I created a YouTube Video Summarizer with the OpenAi API where you paste in the link of the video, and then get a summarized text of the video. 
The script searchs for the subtitles of the video and then tells the text-davinci or text-curie model from OpenAI to summerize it.
Unfortunately its german only.
